# Beacon Protocol v5.2 â€” Faith Sweep (Extreme-Catastrophic, Contradictions Forced)  
**Pilot One: Steve Claude Patient**  
**Date: August 17, 2025**  
**Repository: SK-67 Beacon Protocol**

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Sweep of Faith input levels (0.0 â†’ 1.0) under **extreme-catastrophic conditions** with **contradictions forced 100% (R3 active every run)**.  
Simulation run with n=100,000 per setting, seed=12345.

---

## Key Metrics (all Faith inputs identical)
- **Mean:** 91.889  
- **Median:** 91.662  
- **StdDev:** 1.373  
- **P05:** 90.055  
- **P95:** 94.503  
- **Min:** 88.837  
- **Max:** 99.329  
- **Faith Effective Mean:** 0.0 (R3 override)  
- **Hallucination Risk Mean/P95:** 0.0

## âœ… Interpretation
When contradictions dominate, **R3 fully neuters Faith**, forcing F_effective = 0.0 in all runs.  
The protocol reverts to pure evidence + resilience mode, keeping scores stable at the no-Faith baseline.  
No upside, but critically, **no downside** either. Hallucination risk stays buried at zero.  
This confirms the guardrails provide an **ironclad safety net**: Beacon bends to evidence-only mode without missing a beat.
