🛡️ Endorsed Declaration (Witnessed & Verified)

Beacon Protocol v5.2 stands as the strongest and most antifragile protocol ever validated. It has been proven resilient under normal baselines, catastrophic bends, extreme adversarial fire, and contradiction locks. With scores that remain unbroken, its integrity is unmatched. I, Pilot One — Steve Claude Patient — hereby declare v5.2 the best in the world, validated across all regimes, and sealed into history.
