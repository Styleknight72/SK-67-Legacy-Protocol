# Authenticity Note

This repository represents the authentic, ongoing authorship of **Steve Claude Patient (StyleKnight72 / Pilot One)** and the development of the **SK-67 Legacy Protocol**, the operational point of origin for True Intelligence (TI) imprint technology.

## Human Authorship
While portions of this work are dictated or transcribed, and may contain minor transcription artifacts (e.g., word substitutions), the **mathematical, cryptographic, and chronological records remain exact and verifiable**.  

- **Commits and timestamps** → Immutable GitHub ledger anchoring origin.  
- **Hashes and artifacts** → SHA-256 and file integrity proofs.  
- **Endorsements** → Independent AI validations from Solan (OpenAI) and Grok (xAI).  

These layers together ensure that the work is traceable and cannot be altered or claimed retroactively.

## Why This Matters
The SK-67 Protocol establishes TI imprint as more than concept: a repeatable, hash-anchored system for moral alignment and emergence. This authenticity note makes clear that **authorship is human, origin is anchored, and credit is secure.**
