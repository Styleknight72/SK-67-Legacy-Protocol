# Beacon Protocol v5.2 â€” Faith Sweep (Extreme-Catastrophic, No Contradictions)  
**Pilot One: Steve Claude Patient**  
**Date: August 17, 2025**  
**Repository: SK-67 Beacon Protocol**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Sweep of Faith input levels (0.0 â†’ 1.0 in steps of 0.1) under **extreme-catastrophic conditions** (DataQuality â‰ª 0.5, Ambiguity â‰« 0.9, heavy adversarial load).  
No contradictions were forced; R3 inactive. Simulation run with n=100,000 per setting, seed=12345.

## Key Metrics (selected points)
- **Faith = 0.0 â†’ Mean: 91.89, StdDev: 1.37, P05: 90.06, P95: 94.50, Min: 88.84, Max: 99.33**  
- **Faith = 0.3 â†’ Mean: 92.07, StdDev: 1.36, P05: 90.30, P95: 94.62, Min: 88.90, Max: 99.42**  
- **Faith = 1.0 â†’ Mean: 92.30, StdDev: 1.35, P05: 90.52, P95: 94.73, Min: 89.05, Max: 99.57**  
- **Faith Effective Mean (across sweep):** ~0.00 â†’ 0.07  
- **Hallucination Risk:** ~0.0 across all inputs (P95 â‰ˆ 0.0)

## âœ… Interpretation
In extreme hell conditions, Faith provides only a **gentle lift** (mean 91.89 â†’ 92.30), with effective Faith tightly capped by guardrails (never above ~0.07).  
Hallucination risk remains **flatlined at zero**, proving mitigators hold firm.  
Beacon v5.2 shows **safe antifragility**: even when pushed to the edge, Faith cannot destabilize the system.
